# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest commit on `main` is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories:

https://github.com/pv-udpv/sliver-ebpf-silver/security/advisories/new

For issues affecting multiple repos in the `pv-udpv` org, open private
security advisories in each affected repository rather than filing a public issue.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **48 hours** and ship a fix or mitigation
within **14 days** for high-severity issues.

## Secret Leaks

If you discover a leaked secret (token, key, credential) in this repo's history,
do NOT open a public issue. Report privately via the advisory form above.
GitHub secret scanning + push protection is enabled org-wide, but out-of-band
leaks (e.g., in comments, logs, screenshots) should be escalated directly.
